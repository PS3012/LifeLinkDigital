        Imagine your pharma production is brewing smoothly, then suddenly, quality issues arise, leaving you scrambling
        to find the culprit. Enter Automated Root Cause Analysis (ARCA), a digital detective that sifts through
        mountains of data to quickly and accurately identify the root cause of your problems. Think of it as a Sherlock
        Holmes for pharma, saving you time, money, and ensuring the continued quality and safety of your potions.
